* Introduction
** Goals of this talk

- Preparation for mixed-effects workshop in June
- Provide an overview of topics in mixed-effects modeling
- “Zero to sixty”
- (unfortunately) not an in-depth tutorial
  - Though we will be interacting with R
- Aim: provide participants with the “lay of the land” in order to ask the right questions

** Background on modeling
*** What modeling is

- There are a two fundamental ways of looking at statistical modeling
- *Engineering solution* give me the correct answer, it doesnʼt matter how you get there
- *Scientific solution* tell me how the world works
- The tension between these ideas underlies a lot of the groundwork of using statistical models for research

*** Another way to look at modeling

- Thereʼs another way to look at statistical models, however
- Dodges the tension between the scientific and engineering approaches
- Illuminates some aspects of the structure of modeling problems
- Models as *data compression*

*** Data compression: the basics

- One kind of familiar data compression: ZIP files
  - Take a computer file, make it smaller
- Letʼs try to develop our own miniature compression scheme

*** Notes

- “X” is *more likely* to appear than “Y” – we are using the language of probability to describe our model
- The model is based on assumptions about the world (the English language) that could turn out to be wrong
- This is a staatistical model!

*** Lossless vs. lossy compression

- This toy example (as well as the ZIP file format) are examples of lossless compression – you can recover the original data with perfect fidelity
- Not all compression is lossless; some is lossy

*** Lossy compression example

- A familiar example of a lossy compression format is JPEG images
- Not all the information your eye sees is in the image file
- JPEG has a model of how images look
- When the world doesnʼt line up to this model, the result looks bad

#+reveal: split

* Compression and models

- The kinds of statistical models weʼll be talking about in these seminars are lossy
- They divide the information in the data into two parts
  - Parameters
  - Residuals
- R^2 is a measure of how much of the variance in the data is explained by the parameters

** Exercise 1

- Open up R on your machine
- Run this code:

#+begin_src R :eval no
install.pacakges("shiny")
library(shiny)
runGitHub("aecay/leeds-modeling-wkshp-2017", subdir = "shiny/w1/")
#+end_src

** What are we doing?

- Dataset of reaction times in a lexical decision task, from [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278621/][the British Lexicon Project]].
- Random subset of 500 words (to keep computations managable)
- Predictors:

*************** TODO donʼt make the definition list entries fragments :noexport:
*************** END



#+attr_html: :style font-size:30%
- lexicality :: word or non-word
- nletters :: number of letters in the stimulus
- subtlex.frequency :: frequency of the stimulus in the SUBTLEX corpus
- summed.bigram :: sum of bigram frequencies in the word
- OLD20 :: a measure of neighborhood density
- part3 :: remainder when dividing the participantʼs study ID by 3
- lett.odd :: did the word start with an odd-numbered letter of the alphabet


- See what you can come up with...

** What have we learned

- Adding linguistically useful predictors to the model increases the R^2
- But so does adding completely random predictors!
- In fact, adding an extra predictor will *always* increase R^2 (sometimes just imperceptibly)
- So, we need more sophisticated means than R^2 to determine what predictors to keep in a model
  - Topic of session 3
- Now, letʼs shift gears and think about what a predictor is

* Translating hypotheses to models

#+attr_html: :style font-size:80%
- In the previous exercise, we had a very basic notion of predictors
- Now we want to make this more explicit
- The basic regression model: linear regression
  - $\hat{y}_i = \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$
- Each i is one observation; x is a vector of features; \beta is fit by the model
- We pick what the elements of $x_i$ are
  - The structure of x corresponds to the structure of our hypotheses

** (In)dependent variables

- The most common way of describing the structure of a statistical model uses the terms “dependent variable” and “independent variable”
  - dependent variable :: the y in the equation.  The value of y depends on the value of x.
  - independent variable :: the x in the equation.  It does not depend on y.

*************** TODO carry over the title onto slides after the split :noexport:
*************** END


#+reveal: split

- This terminology is a mess
  - It implies that x is causally prior to y, but this is not necessarily the case
  - It implies that the xʼs are independent of each other, but (ditto)
  - Itʼs confusing

#+reveal: split

- Weʼre stuck with it, though
- Sometimes the independent variables (xʼs) are also referred to as predictors, and y as the outcome.
  A bit clearer, but not totally standard.
  - Iʼll try to use this terminology for the presentation

** Linear terms

- The simplest statistical model is of a linear relationship between a predictor and an outcome
  - F° = $\frac{9}{5}$ C° + 32
- Because of this, linear models are the most often used in science
  - Not necessarily because linear relationships are underlyingly true

#+reveal: split

*** Imperfect but useful

#+attr_html: :style font-size:70%
- Nonetheless, linear regression can be useful to describe trends in the data
- R has a special object for describing the structure of models: the formula
  - ~outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2 + ...~
- This resembles, but is not exactly, the mathematical formula for the regression
  - Itʼs missing the intercept term: the value that ~outcome~ will take on when all the predictors are 0
  - Itʼs missing \epsilon
- In order to fit a Linear Model in R, use the ~lm~ function
  - src_R{lm(outcome ~ predictors, data = my.data)}

*** Fitting linear models in R

- The output of ~lm~ isnʼt maximally informative

#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
lm(rt ~ nletters, data = dat)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:
: Call:
: lm(formula = rt ~ nletters, data = dat)
:
: Coefficients:
: (Intercept)     nletters
:      567.10        10.48

*** A better way

- So we ask for the summary of the linear model
  - (Counterintuitively, the summary is longer and more informative than the model itself)
  - Lots of objects in R can be summarized, not only models

#+begin_src R :exports both :results output
summary(lm(rt ~ nletters, data = dat))
#+end_src

#+attr_html: :style font-size:30%

#+end_example

*** Trying it ourselves

- Try to fit a model that has both ~nletters~ and ~summed.bigram~ as predictors
- What do you notice?

*** P-values

- There are two types of p-values in the model output
- The first: associated with each predictor
  - A statistical test: does the model fit better with this predictor or without it?
- The second: associated with the model
  - Does this model fit better than no model at all
  - Unless you are doing something really silly, this will always be very small

#+reveal: split

- Experiment with adding and subtracting predictors in Exercise 2
  - What do you notice about the p-values?
    Is it possible to give one single “true” p-value for each predictor?

** Nonlinear terms

- The popularity of linear regression raises the question: what about cases where the linearity assumption doesnʼt hold?
- Weʼll consider two cases:
  - Non-numeric predictors
  - Curvilinear relationships

*** Nonnumeric predictors

- What if we are trying to predict reaction time by lexicality?
- 575 + 10 * (is not a word) = ???
- What happens if we try this in the interactive model?
- One value is the default, the other is assigned a predictor
- What happens with a ternary value like ~part3~?
- Is this the only way to do it?

*** Curvilinear predictors

- Itʼs also possible for a predictor to have a curvilinear relationship with an outcome

  #+name: sickle-cell
  #+header: :width 4 :height 3
  #+begin_src R :results value graphics :file-ext svg :exports results
    sc <- data.frame(x = c(0,1,2), y = c(1,2,0))

    ggplot(sc, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("Copies of sickle-cell gene") +
    ylab("Health")
  #+end_src

  #+name: fig:sickle-cell
  #+results: sickle-cell
  [[file:sickle-cell.svg]]

- This doesnʼt come up in our example dataset, but it is worth keeping in mind

** Interaction terms

- A single predictor might have different effects in different contexts
- An example from our dataset: lexicality and bigram frequency

#+name: interaction1
#+header: :width 6 :height 4
#+begin_src R :results value graphics :file-ext svg :exports results
  ggplot(dat, aes(x = summed.bigram, y = rt, color = lexicality)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
#+end_src

#+attr_reveal: :frag t

#+reveal: split

#+name: interaction2
#+header: :width 6 :height 4
#+begin_src R :results value graphics :file-ext svg :exports results
  ggplot(dat, aes(x = summed.bigram, y = rt, color = lexicality)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: interaction2
[[file:interaction2.svg]]

*** Whats going on here?

- (NB this is not an attempt to actually explain this phenomenon)
- Maybe: there is a difference in what speakers do for words and non-words
- For words:
  #+attr_html: :style font-size:50%
  - Look the word up by meaning
  - “Hash table” algorithm
  - Takes ~constant time
- For non-words:
  #+attr_html: :style font-size:50%
  - Search through all the words you know to make sure itʼs not there
  - “List search” algorithm
  - Takes time proportional to the wordʼs length

*** Illustration

- The most bigram-frequent non-word in the data is “trainstessed”
  #+attr_html: :style font-size:50%
  - It looks very word-like
  - It contains meaningful morphemes (train, -ed)
  - Itʼs long (12 letters, 3 syllables)
  - It takes a (relatively) long time to satisfy ourselves that this is not in fact a word
- Compare “gix”, one of the most bigram-infrequent words in the sample
  - We can rapidly be sure itʼs not a word
- (Aside: bigram frequency should probably be normalized by length)

*** Modeling

- Whatever the underlying reasons, we want our model to take this property of the data into account
- If we ignore it, we will just fit one effect for summed bigram frequency

  #+name: interaction3
  #+header: :width 6 :height 4
  #+begin_src R :results value graphics :file-ext svg :exports results
    ggplot(dat, aes(x = summed.bigram, y = rt)) +
    geom_smooth(aes(color = lexicality), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: interaction3
   [[file:interaction3.svg]]

*** Interactions in R

- In order to fit an interaction term in R, we use the multiplication notation: ~predictor1*predictor2~
- This is shorthand for three predictors:
  - ~predictor1~
  - ~predictor2~
  - the two predictors multiplied together (notated ~predictor1:predictor2~)

#+reveal: split

- Look at Exercise 3, which is the same as Exercise 2 with the choice added for an interaction term
  - Can you demonstrate that the ~*~ notation adds the predictors I said it should?  That is, that you can simply write ~summed.bigram*lexicality~, not ~summed.bigram*lexicality + summed.bigram + lexicality~?
  - What happens to the p-values when you add the interaction term?

** Nonlinear outputs

*** Non-numeric outputs

- What if your output isnʼt numeric?
- Forced choice judgment task, corpus data (ing vs. inʼ)
- One possible answer: predict the “chance” of one outcome or the other
  - If prediction is > 0.5 guess “yes”, else “no”
- This basically works

*** The logistic curve

- But not with a linear model

#+name: logistic
#+header: :width 4 :height 4
#+begin_src R :results value graphics :file-ext svg :exports results
  logistic <- data.frame(x = seq(-4,4,length.out=200))
  logistic$y <- plogis(logistic$x)
  ggplot(logistic, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line()
#+end_src

#+name: fig:logistic
#+results: logistic
[[file:logistic.svg]]

** Non-linear outputs

- What if the relationship between the input and the output is not linear?
- If I give my tomatoes 1 gallon of water, they grow a foot
  - 100 gallons \to 100 feet?
- The solution is transforming the data
  - Square, square root, logarithm...
  - Sometimes you know what to use, sometimes you try to figure it out from the data
- More on this topic coming up right now...

* Checking assumptions

** Assumptions of linear models

- Letʼs get back to our data compression example for a moment
- Which is more compressed?

#+begin_center
#+attr_html: :style font-size:30%
: 6 6 6 6 5 4 2 6 6 3 1 4 5 1 2 2 1 2 3 6 4 6 4 6 2 1
: 2 6 2 2 6 1 6 1 6 3 6 6 2 2 2 4 3 5 5 3 5 2 3 4 4 6
: 2 4 4 4 6 4 2 1 5 4 4 3 2 5 5 3 1 2 1 4 1 3 6 4 5 3
#+end_center

|     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
| 16.6% | 16.6% | 16.6% | 16.6% | 16.6% | 16.6% |

** Compression gone awry

#+attr_html: :width 30%
[[file:snakesladders.jpg]]

- 2 5 vs. 5 2

** Residuals and compression

- Residuals in a model are a long list of random numbers
  - They look like rolls of a die
- They compress much better if order doesnʼt matter
- Important assumption of linear models: /homoskedastic residuals/
  - “same variance”

** Plotting to check homoskedasticity

- Homoskedasticity can be checked on a fitted-residual plot

#+name: fitted-resid
#+header: :width 6 :height 3
#+begin_src R :results value graphics :file-ext svg :exports results
  mod <- lm(rt ~ nletters + subtlex.frequency + summed.bigram * lexicality + OLD20 + lett.odd + part3, data = dat)
  ggplot(data.frame(x = fitted(mod), y = resid(mod)), aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  xlab("Fitted") + ylab("Residual")
#+end_src

#+name: fig:fitted-resid

* Homoskedasticity and mixed effects models

** The problem

- We can never, ever assume that residuals are homoskedastic in linguistics
  - Speakers
  - Words
- We need to tell the model about this, or it will be misled
- The answer: mixed-effects models

** Towards a solution

- Predictors in a model “control” for sources of variability
- One idea: letʼs just add another predictor to the model for subject, to “control” subject level-variability
  - ~outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2 + subject~

#+reveal: split

- Whatʼs wrong with this idea?
  - It introduces lots of parameters to the model
  - It allows subjects to vary too much
- This second one Iʼll call “parameter identification”
  - Is an effect due to (e.g.) gender, or is it because Peter, Paul, and Mary are just different people?

** Mixed-effects models

- Intuition: most subjects are like the average subject
- This sounds trivial, but itʼs not
  - Compare: most treatments are like the average treatment
  - ...placebo, caffeine, alcohol, Adderall, chloroform
- Add a predictor to the model per subject, but constrain it to follow a normal distribution

** Benefits of mixed effects models

- Solves the many-parameters problem: we only need 2 (mean, variance) regardless of how many subjects we have
- Solves the parameter identification problem: only a certain amount of variance can be attributed to subject effect; the rest should be allocated to other predictors (or \epsilon{})

** Mixed effects models: the terminological swamp

- Unfortunately, statisticians/practitioners donʼt have good, consistent vocab for talking about these models
- Fixed/random effects
- Mixed-effects
- Hierarchical models
- Because of this, one of the easiest ways to communicate about these models is through code

** Mixed effect models in R

- The usual formula syntax is extended to represent mixed-effects models
  - Technical note: Iʼm using the widespread ~lme4~ syntax in this talk

#+begin_center
~outcome ~ predictors + (1 | subject)~
#+end_center

** Experimenting with mixed effects models

- Switch over to exercise 5
- What you see: a comparison of the coefficients in a mixed and non-mixed model, plus the summary of the mixed model
- Focus on the latter: whatʼs different?
  - Scaling of predictors
  - Random effect estimates
  - Where are the p-values?
- Now look at the coefficient comparisons: how does mixed-effects-ness affect the results?

** Results of mixed-effect models

- It looks like mixed effects models havenʼt been very revolutionary here
- We might have expected this
  - Balanced design
  - Many participants
  - Many stimuli
  - Itʼs not a bad thing!

#+reveal: split

- Where are mixed-effects models more useful?
  - Unbalanced designs
  - Corpus work
  - Clamping down on potentially spurious effects
  - Conceptually better model

** Wrapping up

- Today
  - Introduction to modeling issues
  - Motivation of mixed-effects modeling
- Next time
  - How to get p-values back (or more accurately, how to compare models and evaluate the contribution of predictors)
  - More details on constructing mixed-effects models to fit research scenarios
